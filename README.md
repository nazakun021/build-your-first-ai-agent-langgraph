# Build Your First AI Agent with LangGraph

## Introduction

This workshop will walk you through building your very first AI agent using **LangGraph**, a framework built on top of LangChain for creating agentic applications.  

Weâ€™ll cover:  
- Setting up your environment  
- Running Jupyter notebooks for experimentation  
- Using LangGraph Studio to visualize and debug your agents  
- Exploring APIs and integrations like GroqCloud, Google AI Studio and Tavily  

By the end of this workshop, youâ€™ll have a working understanding of LangGraph, as well as a few custom-built agents you can extend further.  

## Setup

### Python version

To get the most out of this course, please ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later. 
This version is required for optimal compatibility with LangGraph. If you're on an older version, 
upgrading will ensure everything runs smoothly.
```
python3 --version
```

### Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/nazakun021/build-your-first-ai-agent-langgraph.git
cd build-your-first-ai-agent-langgraph
```

### Create an environment and install dependencies
#### Mac/Linux/WSL
```
python3 -m venv langgraph-workshop-env
source langgraph-workshop-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Windows Powershell
```
python3 -m venv langgraph-workshop-env
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
langgraph-workshop-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running notebooks
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Setting up env variables
Briefly going over how to set up environment variables. You can also 
use a `.env` file with `python-dotenv` library.
#### Mac/Linux/WSL
```
export API_ENV_VAR="your-api-key-here"
```
#### Windows Powershell
```
$env:API_ENV_VAR = "your-api-key-here"
```

### Set GroqCloud API key
* If you don't have an GroqCloud API key, you can sign up [here](https://console.groq.com/).
*  Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment 

### Sign up and Set LangSmith API
* Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://smith.langchain.com/), find out more about LangSmith
* and how to use it within your workflow [here](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), and relevant library [docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)!
*  Set `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` in your environment 

### Set up Tavily API for web search

* Tavily Search API is a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG, aimed at efficient, 
quick, and persistent search results. 
* You can sign up for an API key [here](https://tavily.com/). 
It's easy to sign up and offers a very generous free tier. Some notebooks later will use Tavily. 

* Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in your environment.

### Set up LangGraph Studio

* LangGraph Studio is a custom IDE for viewing and testing agents.
* Studio can be run locally and opened in your browser on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
* See documentation [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/#local-development-server) on the local Studio development server and [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/local-studio/#run-the-development-server). 
* Graphs for LangGraph Studio are in the `x-topic/studio/` folders.
* To start the local development server, run the following command in your terminal in the `/studio` directory each module:

```
langgraph dev
```

You should see the following output:
```
- ðŸš€ API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- ðŸŽ¨ Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- ðŸ“š API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs
```

Open your browser and navigate to the Studio UI: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.

* To use Studio, you will need to create a .env file with the relevant API keys
